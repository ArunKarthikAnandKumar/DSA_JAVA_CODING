# 1. Minmum,Maximum ,No of Ways
it is Dynamic Programing

You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array days. Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.

Train tickets are sold in three different ways:

a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars,
a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars, and
a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.
The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total, you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.
```
```
Example 2:

Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total, you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

CODE:
Code Explanation:
Method Signature:

The method mincostTickets takes two input parameters:
days[]: an array of integers representing the days of the year on which the person plans to travel.
costs[]: an array of integers representing the cost of three different passes (1-day, 7-day, and 30-day).
Variable Initialization:

lastDay: Stores the last day of travel, i.e., the last element in the days array.
dp[]: An array to store the minimum travel cost for each day up to lastDay. The size of dp[] is lastDay + 1 to accommodate all possible days from 0 to lastDay.
dp[i] will represent the minimum cost to cover travel up to day i.
Base case: dp[0] = 0, meaning no cost is incurred when there are no travel days.
Main Logic:

The code loops through all days from 1 to lastDay. For each day i, it checks if it's a travel day (i.e., a day present in the days[] array).
Non-Travel Day:

If the current day i is not in days[] (determined by the contains method), the minimum cost on that day will be the same as the previous day (dp[i-1]), because thereâ€™s no need to purchase any pass.
Travel Day:

If the current day i is a travel day, the minimum cost is calculated by considering the three possible options:
1-day pass: The cost of using a 1-day pass on day i is dp[i-1] + costs[0].
7-day pass: The cost of using a 7-day pass starting on day i is dp[i-7] + costs[1]. If i is less than 7, it means this 7-day pass covers all previous days, so just use costs[1].
30-day pass: Similarly, the cost of using a 30-day pass is dp[i-30] + costs[2], and if i is less than 30, the pass covers all previous days, so just use costs[2].
The minimum of these three values is chosen and stored in dp[i], ensuring that the cheapest option is always used.
Return Value:

After processing all days, the final cost for the last travel day (lastDay) is stored in dp[lastDay], which is returned as the result.

```
class Solution {
    public int mincostTickets(int[] days, int[] costs) {
        int lastDay = days[days.length-1];
        int[] dp = new int[lastDay+1];
        // Base case: no travel
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        // Iterate over each day
        for (int i = 1; i <= lastDay; i++) {
            // If day i is not a travel day, then cost is same as day before
            if (!contains(days, i)) {
                dp[i] = dp[i-1];
            }
            // Otherwise, we need to find the minimum cost of the three options
            else {
                // Option 1: 1-day pass
                int cost1 = dp[i-1] + costs[0];
                // Option 2: 7-day pass
                int cost2 = (i >= 7) ? dp[i-7] + costs[1] : costs[1];
                // Option 3: 30-day pass
                int cost3 = (i >= 30) ? dp[i-30] + costs[2] : costs[2];
                // Take the minimum cost of the three options
                dp[i] = Math.min(cost1, Math.min(cost2, cost3));
            }
        }
        // Return the cost for the last day
        return dp[lastDay];
    }
    
    // Helper method to check if an array contains a given value
    private boolean contains(int[] arr, int val) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == val) {

  # TCS DAY 2

  Given an array of positive integer nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to the target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

Example 1
Input: 
7
6
2 3 1 2 4 3
Output: 
2

```
public class Solution {
    public int minSubArrayLen(int target, int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int left = 0, currentSum = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            currentSum += nums[right];

            // Shrink the window from the left if the sum is greater than or equal to the target

                minLength = Math.min(minLength, right - left + 1);
                currentSum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
        }

        // If no valid subarray found, return 0
        return minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : minLength;
    }
}

# Given an integer array nums, return the number of subarrays filled with 0.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array
Example 1
Input: 
8
1 3 0 0 2 0 0 4
Output:
6

Explanation:
There are 4 occurrences of [0] as a subarray.
There are 2 occurrences of [0,0] as a subarray.
There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size more than 2 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 6.

# Find the Duplicate Number

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive, there is only one repeated number in `nums`. Your task is to return this repeated number.

### Constraints
- You must solve the problem without modifying the array `nums`.
- Use only constant extra space.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`nums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]`  
**Output:**  
`2`

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`nums = [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]`  
**Output:**  
`3`

Logic
Follow the below steps to solve the problem:

Calculate the sum of array elements and the sum of first (N-1) natural numbers
Return (array sum) â€“ ((N-1) natural numbers sum)

```
  static int findRepeating(int[] arr, int N)
    {
        // Find array sum and subtract sum
        // first n-1 natural numbers from it
        // to find the result.
 
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
            sum += arr[i];
        return sum - (((N - 1) * N) / 2);
    }
```

#  Subarray Sum Equals K
Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
Output: 2

hashMap with count 0:1 suppose if whole array sum k;
keep adding current value;

![Architecture Diagram](SumSubK.png)

logic similar to sum we check the curr sum and diff if exist in HashMap add add that count to result 
and add current count value to HM

```
class Solution {
    public int subarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        HashMap<Integer,Integer> hm=new HashMap<>();
        hm.put(0,1);
        int curr=0;
        int res=0;
        for(int n:nums){
            curr+=n;
            int dif=curr-k;
            res+=hm.getOrDefault(dif,0);
            hm.put(curr,hm.getOrDefault(curr,0)+1);

        }
        return res;

        
    }
}
```

Companies
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of non-empty subarrays that have a sum divisible by k.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], k = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by k = 5:
[4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1], [5], [5, 0], [5, 0, -2, -3], [0], [0, -2, -3], [-2, -3]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5], k = 9
Output: 0
    

```
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int subarraysDivByK(int[] nums, int k) {
        int res = 0;
        int currSum = 0;
        int[] prefixSum = new int[k]; // Store frequency of remainders
        prefixSum[0] = 1; // There's one way to get a sum divisible by `k` (empty subarray)

        for (int n1 : nums) {
            currSum += n1;
            int rem = currSum % k;

            // Handle negative remainders to ensure they're positive
            if (rem < 0) {
                rem += k;
            }

            // Add the count of subarrays that had the same remainder
            res += prefixSum[rem];

            // Increment the count of this remainder
            prefixSum[rem]++;
        }

        return res;
    }
}

```
