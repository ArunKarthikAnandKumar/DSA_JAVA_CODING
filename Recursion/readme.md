** For any Recursion There is baiscaly 2 Main approach**
1. Perform calulation and return that number
```
return n+recur(n-1);
```

2. In recursion Function only pass a variable to keep track

recur(i-1,sum+i)

The main thing in recursion if Multiple present first execute in orderwise then returns

Mainly 2 approach 
top down keep printing as we go down

Bottom up first go down then only while reurning Print
